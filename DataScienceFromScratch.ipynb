Smart cars collecting driving habits, smart homes collect living habits, and smart marketers collect purchasing habits. The internet itself represents a huge graph of knowledge that contains (among other things) an enormous cross-referenced encyclopedia; domain-specific databases about movies, music,sports results, pinball machines, memes, and ocktails; and too. many government statistics (some of them nearly true!) from too many governments to wrap your head around.\n",
