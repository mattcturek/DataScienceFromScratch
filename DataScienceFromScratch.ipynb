Your smartphone is building up a record of your location and speed every second of every day. \"Quantified selfers\" wear pedometers-on-steroids that are always recording their hear rates, movement habits, diet, and sleep patterns. Smart cars collecting driving habits, smart homes collect living habits, and smart marketers collect purchasing habits. The internet itself represents a huge graph of knowledge that contains (among other things) an enormous cross-referenced encyclopedia; domain-specific databases about movies, music,sports results, pinball machines, memes, and ocktails; and too. many government statistics (some of them nearly true!) from too many governments to wrap your head around.\n",

Some are machine learning experts, while others couldn't machine-learn their way out of kindergarten. Some are PhDs with impressive publication records, while others have never read an academic paper (shame on them).
